			<p>"In fact, I enjoy the happiness of figuring things out myself, and then share my ideas with different kinds of people. When you’re chatting with them, you won’t get that strange ‘talkin’-to-a-teacher’ feeling . . the teachers provides you with experiences by being a student, asking questions, exploring with you, hearing your opinions. They could always turn boring subjects (like essay writing) into humorous experiences. . . Attending the SFS classes, not only my reading, analyzing and writing skills were improved, I also learned how to find appropriate ways to reach my destinations. And of course, I made a lot of friends.”</p>
