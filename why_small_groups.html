        <h1>Article: Why Small Groups?</h1>
		<blockquote>“In the new global economy, with many jobs being either automated or “off-shored,” what skills will students need to build successful careers? What skills will they need to be <em>good citizens?</em>”
		</blockquote>

		<p> In pursuit of these questions, Harvard Learning Expert Tony Wagner conducted interviews with hundreds of business leaders across industries and companies from Apple to Unilever, asking what skills are their companies look for in new hires (Wagner,2008). Surprisingly, many leaders felt that technological skills were less urgent and could be developed overtime, but one of the key essential skills was collaboration. </p>
		
		<p>“Teamwork is no longer just about working with others in your building.” Christie Pedra, CEO of Siemens, explained, “Technology has allowed for virtual teams. We have teams working on major infrastructure projects that are all over the U.S. On other projects, you’re working with people all around the world on solving a software problem. Every week they’re on a variety of conference calls; they’re doing Web casts.” </p>
		<p>Mike Summers, vice president for Global Talent Management at Dell, said，. “Kids just out of school have an amazing lack of preparedness in general leadership skills and collaborative skills.” 
		</p>
		<p>As an educator, the lack of collaborative skills is something that I personally see in many students I have begun to work with internationally. At the outset, many students are clearly accustomed to listening and waiting to be told the next bit of information. All too often, classrooms are still set up in a nature that information is spoon fed from to the teacher to the learner. Such habits and environments are not suitable for preparing students for the types of working environments and collaborative abilities that are increasingly in demand.</p>
		<p>Luckily, not only are group learning abilities in the work place in demand, the act of group learning can be incredibly beneficial to learning.  “In Vgotsky’s sociocultural perspective, learning is inherently social; the internalization of interactions transforms ways of thinking.” (Wilson, 2013) However, “Learners are in groups all the time while they are in school but not all these groups are learning groups.
		</p>
		<p>If facilitated effectively, small groups can become spaces where learning is purposeful, social, emotional and empowering. Learning to engage in deep conversations and learning online is not only beneficial for the study experience that students are currently engaged in, but in this process they are developing skills, abilities and dispositions that are essential to workplaces of the future, and for creating the workplaces of the future. In relation to the study of English, I believe that collaborative learning and local-global exploration holds potential for students to develop a deeper motivation and dedication to language study and learning. It can help students realize that the study of language is not just about being to pass a test, but can be about developing an ability to  explore and collaborate as a part of a larger world. </p>
